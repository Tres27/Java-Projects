# Java-Projects
In this repository I will have the different projects I have made with the help of the java programming language.

Project 1 - In this project I just wrote a Java program to print an ASCII art.

Project 2 - In this project I created a Java program to calculate the total cost of ordering t-shirt. It is a user input java program.
            in which the user can set the price of each shirt and how much he/she wants to buy. Also if the user buy more than 5 shirt, 
            the user a discount of 50% on the additional t-shirt.
