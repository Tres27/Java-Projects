# Java-Projects
In this repository I will have the different projects I have made with the help of the java programming language. All the projects were written in BlueJ.

Project 1 - In this project I just wrote a Java program to print an ASCII art.

Project 2 - In this project I created a Java program to calculate the total cost of ordering t-shirt. It is a user input java program.
            in which the user can set the price of each shirt and how much he/she wants to buy. Also if the user buy more than 5 shirt, 
            the user a discount of 50% on the additional t-shirt.
        
Project 3 - In this project I wrote a program in which user can input 10 score and those which are within 90 and 100 and 80 and 90 are
            counted. In the end it shows it shows how many number the user have input are in those ranges.
